      D.D. F.R. and A. SS.
    </p>
    <p>
      To whom, Sir, could the republication of this little history with more
      propriety be addressed, than to a gentleman to whom it is under such
      considerable obligations? When it first appeared, it was honoured with
      your notice in an especial manner; and is not a little benefited by your
      <i>labours</i>. You, Sir, with a <i>careful</i> hand noted its errors; and
      what has stood the test of your strictures is certainly established with
      additional authority. Whatever might be the motives which influenced <i>so
      vigorous</i> an exertion of your <i>learned</i> and <i>critical</i> powers&mdash;powers
      so universally acknowledged and respected, the author of this piece will
      not now inquire: it is sufficient to him, that they operated to the
      extending the knowledge of his tract, among that class of readers who
      stood most in need of the information it furnished; and he is persuaded
      you will with pleasure hear his assurances, that the work owes no small
      share of what approbation it may have gained, to your <i>elaborate review</i>
      of it. Several worthy pious persons having candidly declared in private
      conversation, (and unknowingly to the author himself) that the perusal of
      your book really strengthened the facts advanced in the history. For this,
      therefore, he considers you as entitled to his thanks; and that his
      acknowledgments might be as public as the obligation, no method of
      conveyance seemed more proper, than to prefix them to this new Edition of
      "<i>The History of the Man after God's own Heart.</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      He scorns, Sir, to follow the practice of Dedicators in common, who, from
      venal motives, surfeit their patrons with fulsome adulation: he will not,
      therefore, call the blushes into your countenance, by expressing his
      private sentiments of your <i>learned</i> Review of this Historical
      Sketch, farther than by one observation; which is, that had you been
      totally unknown in the republic of letters before, your apology for the
      death of Uriah would alone have raised your literary fame beyond the power
      of envious detraction. However, not to offend your modesty, he desists
      from farther encomiums; but with a wish that you may long live to enjoy
      the reputation acquired by so <i>laudable</i> a performance, he concludes
      with subscribing himself,

    <h2>
      PREFACE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some reverend panegyrists* on our late king,** have, a little
      unfortunately, been fond of comparing him with a monarch in no respect
      resembling him; except in the length of his reign, thirty and three years:
      which a lucky text informed them to be the duration of David's sovereignty
      over the Hebrew nation. Had our good old king died a year sooner, or had
      we been indulged with him a year longer, the opportunity of applying this
      text would then have been lost; and in either case we might not have heard
      of the parallel.
    </p>
    <p>
      A reverence for the memory of a worthy Prince, has occasioned the world's
      being troubled with a new history of king David, (which, otherwise might
      not have appeared) merely to shew how the memory of the British monarch is
      affected by the comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?" is the language of
      Jesus Christ. "Prove all things; hold fast that which is good;" is the
      language of the apostle Paul. The liberty thus granted is unlimited; but
      it is more than mere grant of liberty, these are positive injunctions: let
      no one then be so timid as to resign an inclination to satisfy just
      doubts: in Britain, thanks to the obstinate heresy of our brave
      forefathers, no audacious Romish priest dare prescribe limits to the
      exercise of our reasoning faculties; and Protestant ones surely will not:
      nay, they cannot, consistently with those principles which justify their
      dissent from the Romish communion. An honest desire to obtain truth, will
      sanctify the most rigid scrutiny into every thing. An apostle has told us,
      that we are not to believe even an angel from Heaven, who should preach
      any other gospel than that of Christ;* and, no authority can be so sacred,
      as to set aside the <i>most valuable distinction of humanity</i>, with
      which our Creator has furnished us; or to give the lie to our most
      self-evident conceptions of right and wrong.
    </p>

    <p>
      If that liberty, of which Britons boast the possession, means any thing,
      it must primarily include freedom of thought; without which there can be
      no freedom of action. Thus it must mean an uncontrolled power to examine
      the validity of every proposition offered to our assent; without which
      power, and the due exercise of it, our assent cannot be the assent of
      rational beings. If the reformed religion means any thing, it must mean a
      religion founded by the authority, not of councils and synods, but of
      conviction, the result of private judgment. True Protestants do not puzzle
      themselves about the decisions of Trent, Constance, or Dort; they protest
      against all authoritative dictates; disciples of the meek, the lowly, the
      humane Jesus, they seek of themselves to judge of right or wrong. Who is
      most the Protestant, the friend to human kind, and to truth? Those who
      appeal to the human understanding, and submit to the public judgment
      whether things are really so or not; or those who say, they are so, they
      shall be so, you shall acknowledge them to be so, or else&mdash;&mdash;?

    <p>
      Let not weak-minded Christians who think truth not able to maintain its
      authority without legal enforcements, lament what they call licentious
      abuses of that liberty on which we are happy to congratulate ourselves:
      injudicious productions of the pen will always meet the treatment they
      deserve. Fallacious pretensions to reasoning cannot deceive mankind in
      these liberal times; nor can truth be obscured, when the attention of
      honest inquiries after it, is properly exerted. If the little historical
      sketch which follows, and which in fact, exhibits no more than what we
      have all daily read, without presuming to decide upon; if it really is
      that audacious calumny which many roundly affirm it to be; it will
      doubtless be considered as such: if, on the contrary, it contains
      undeniable matters of fact, fallaciousness will appear in the angry
      objections against it; and the writer trusts, the futility of such
      objections, have already been made sufficiently apparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name of David has never been mentioned by divines but with the
      greatest respect, from the time in which he lived to the present day; and
      he is always quoted as an illustrious example of holiness! so illustrious,
      that the greatest instance of purity that ever existed on earth, was
      frequently saluted by way of eminence, in reference to him, <i>Son of
      David!</i> so illustrious, that on the death of the late king of Great
      Britain, many sermons were preached and published, in which, parallels are
      drawn betwixt him and this standard of piety, in order to justify
      encomiums on the former, by declaring how nearly he resembled the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      In what manner David first acquired, and has ever since maintained, this
      extraordinary reputation, is not difficult to deduce, he was advanced, by
      an enraged prophet, from obscurity to the Hebrew throne; and taught by the
      fate of the unhappy monarch who was raised in the same manner, whom he
      supplanted, and whose family he crushed, he prudently attached himself to
      the cause of his patrons,* and they were the trumpeters of his fame. The
      same order of men, true to their common cause, have continued to sound the
      praise of this church-hero from generation to generation, unto the present
      time: in like manner the grand violator of the English constitution
      obtained the epithet of <i>holy Martyr</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A new scrutiny being made, however, into David's claim to sanctity, which,
      notwithstanding a very learned defence of him, turned out so greatly to
      his dishonour; the scene has been shifted by a few whose sense has
      overbalanced their bigotry by two or three scruples. Some such, like Sheba
      of old, blow the trumpet and cry, "We have no part in David, neither have
      we inheritance in the son of Jesse!" In this manner have some clerical
      weather-cocks veered about to an opposite point of the compass; and David,
      who, till now has been considered as a man who "did that which was right
      in the eyes of the Lord, and turned not aside from any thing that he
      commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah
      the Hittite," has, by one stroke of politics, been resigned to the mercy
      of his detectors; and the importance of the detection endeavoured to be
      annihilated, as the easier task; all which appears with rather an ill
      grace, at a time when it is manifestly extorted.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The Prophets and Priest.
</pre>
    <p>
      Thus much being premised relating to the conduct of the champions for
      orthodoxy, on the occasion of this little squib which has produced so much
      bustle in the clerical hives, proceed we to say something of the tract
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intention was, without any regard to remote objects, or heed of future
      consequences, which in fact ought <i>never</i> to be considered in
      investigating any point; to give a fair undisguised narrative of the life
      and transactions of David, king of Israel.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, however, was not so easy to perform, as it was to project; from
      three difficulties which impeded the execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. It is not easy to conquer the early prejudices of education in favour
      of the Hebrew nation; which the careful inculcation of their story during
      our infancy, hinders our seeing in a proper light: so that relations which
      might shock humanity in what is called prophane history, are read without
      any emotion but that of reverence, in <i>this</i>. This misconception is
      in great measure assisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. By their History being written <i>by themselves</i>: and difficult to
      be corrected.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. By the broken unconnected manner in which it is transmitted down to us:
      which renders it impossible to give a complete narrative of any period in
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A common share of humanity, which a little attention to common sense
      enabled the author to extend to every nation under Heaven as the objects
      of it, relieved him from the first of these difficulties: to overcome the
      other two, he has assumed the liberty of giving <i>his</i> sense to what
      appears dark, or misrepresented; which he hopes will not be denied him, so
      long as it is not found that a forced construction is put upon any thing
      cited; or, that it is represented in any other light than what it
      naturally appears in, when considered with the freedom, which it is our
      duty to use in the examination of every historical record.
    </p>
    <p>
      And lest it should be imagined that too great liberties are taken with the
      biblical writers; it may not be amiss to mention once for all, that
      innumerable instances might be produced, to shew that the authority of <i>the
      Lord</i>, so continually quoted to sanctify every transaction related;
      constituted for the most part, nothing more than national phrases, which
      obtained universally among so bigoted a people as on all occasions the
      Jews appear to have been: one-twelfth part of whom were appropriated to
      the priesthood! A phraseology in some measure similar obtained in England,
      at that time, when shunning the cruel talons of papacy, the people rushed
      into the jaws of wild enthusiasm. That the sense in which the acts of
      David are here understood, is the most obvious and natural, appears from
      the amazing pains it has occasioned his champions, to force another upon
      them. Of this, the Life of David, by Dr. Delany, is a most remarkable
      instance; but the gross palliations, puerile conjectures, and mean shifts
      to which he has been driven, prove the difficulty of the task; while they
      are too frivolous to bias any, but the most <i>Catholic believers</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stockhouse, in his History of the Bible, has urged arguments against
      particular passages, under the title of <i>Objections</i>; so cogent, that
      <i>his answers</i> to them, certainly could not be satisfactory even to
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Chandler has lately added his name to the list of David's apologists.
      Strange! that so holy a king should need the exertion of so much learned
      and critical dexterity, to establish his fame for goodness of heart! This
      gentleman's performance, which was published as a reply to the first
      edition of the present work, is a very extraordinary piece; and shews
      that, great learning is no security for soundness of judgment. The
      Doctor's book has been considered in a letter addressed to him, and
      published separately; to which the reader is referred for an examination
      into the merits of his arguments. In answering the Doctor, new lights
      opened on many occurrences, which, as far as they could be detached from
      that particular controversy, are taken into the present edition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best of kings is a title which adulation and servility have always
      conferred on the most contemptible, as well as the most detestable
      tyrants; and the frequency of its application to the object is ever in
      proportion as he is undeserving of it. Had the flattering sycophants of
      king David been satisfied with applying to him this common-place
      appellation, rational men, who form their conclusions from the result of
      general experience, would have inferred only that he had been one of the
      numerous herd of bad princes who have oppressed mankind, and there would
      have been nothing peculiar either in the fact or the inference. But when
      the extremity of adulation conferred on David the title of <i>The Man
      after God's own heart</i>, thinking men, who know the source from which
      such adulation ever flows, are prepared to expect, in the development of
      his history, a character pre-eminently wicked, and in this they are not
      deceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      All historians of credit agree in describing <i>God's chosen people</i>,
      the <i>Jews</i>, as the most vicious and detestable of mankind;* their own
      historians confirm this character of them, and the whole series of facts
      which constitute their history, prove it beyond a possibility of doubt.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Tacitus describes the Jewish people as formed of the worst
     outcasts of the surrounding nations, collected together by
     Moses, and kept for ever separated from the rest of mankind,
     by an opposition of manners, and hostility of sentiment. Nam
     passimus quisque, spretis religionibus patriis, tributa et
     stipes illuc congerebant; unde auctæ Judeorum res&mdash;ad versus
     omnes alios hostile odium&mdash;transgressi in morem eorum, idem
     usurpent; nec quidquam prius imbuuntur quam contemnere Deos,
     exuere patriam; arentes, liberos, fratres, vilia habere.&mdash;
     Ticiti Hist. Lib. v.
</pre>
    <p>
      Among <i>the chosen people of God</i>&mdash;the most depraved of all
      nations&mdash;it is pretty certain that the worst and wickedest man of
      that nation was David, <i>The Man after God's own heart</i>. The truth of
      this proposition will be abundantly proved in the following short history.
    </p>
    <p>
      A question will here naturally present itself, how the Jews became so much
      more vicious and depraved than their neighbours? And to resolve that
      question, it will be necessary to consider in what respects their laws and
      customs differed from those of others. It will be found that they differed
      most essentially from all other nations in the world in two particulars:
      1st. They had more religion than any other nation; and, 2dly. They had
      more priests. Other nations among whom superstitious rites and ceremonies
      prevailed, were satisfied with practising them on solemn festivals, and
      occasionally on particular or important events; but the Jews practised
      their superstition incessantly: none of the common duties, or ordinary
      functions of life, could be performed by them, without a reference to the
      rules of their superstition; they were bound to a strict observance of
      them whenever they ate, drank, or performed any other of the natural
      functions.* **
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Moses quo sibi in posterum gentem firmaret, novos ritus
     coutrariosque ceteris mortalibus indidit; profana illic
     omnia, quae apud nos sacra; rursum concessa apud illos, quæ
     nobis incesta.&mdash;Seperati epulis, discreti cubilibus,
     projectissima ad libidinem gens, aliena rum cubitu

     It is impossible to draw a more disgusting picture of a
     nation than this elegant and correct historian, in
     describing the Jews.

     ** The Romans, though so numerous and powerful a nation, had
     but very few priests, compared to the Jews. The Augurs were
     at first only 3, and in process of time were increased to
     15. The Arnspices were 12. The Pontifices were at first but
     4, and were afterwards increased to 10. The Flamines were
     but 3. The Sàlit 12. The Feciales, who were 20 in number,
     though classed by authors among the priesthood, were merely
     civil officers employed as heralds. And the Vestals, or Nuns
     of Rome, were only 4; altogether between 50 and 60. Vide
     Kennett's Roman Antiq. And yet Saint Austin, De Cevitate
     Dei, Lib. iv. cap. 15, admits that the Romans were so
     virtuous, that God gave them the empire of the world because
     they were more virtuous than other nations, vet, with true
     Christian charity, he says, that they must nevertheless he
     damned as heathens. We do not find that the priests of other
     enlightened nations of antiquity were proportionality much
     more numerous than amoung the Romans. In England at present
     the number of the priesthood cannot be much less than
     20,000; there are near 10,000 parishes, each having one
     priest at least, several two, and some three or more,
     exclusive of Deans and Chapters, Prebends, &amp;c. &amp;c. and all
     these in the established church, as it is called, exclusive
     of a great variety of other sectaries of different
     denominations.
</pre>
    <p>
      Other nations had a few priests dedicated to their gods or idols, seldom
      exceeding a few dozen in a whole nation but the Jewish priesthood
      constituted a twelfth part of the whole people, and claimed and exercised
      the privilege of devouring a tenth part of the produce of the country,
      without contributing any thing to its productive labour.* And it is
      probable that the Jewish nation alone, though but a miserable handful of
      semi-barbarous savages, had more priests than the rest of the then known
      world collectively, and were consequently more vicious and more enslaved
      than any other people.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The Jewish priesthood being one tribe, or twelfth part of
     the nation, do not appear to have assumed to themselves much
     more than an equal proportion, compared to their numbers, in
     taking the tithe or tenth part of the produce of the land,
     however unjust it may appear that they should be supported
     in idleness at the expence of the industry of the rest: but
     the English priesthood, though abundantly numerous, do not
     form above one five-hundredth part of the whole nation, yet
     they have the conscience to take also the tenth of the whole
     produce, which is near fifty times more than their just
     share, according to the proportion of their romish models,
     from whose example they pretend to derive them.
</pre>
    <p>
      Mankind have been too long duped by that universal <i>cant</i> of priests,
      who, in their language, have ever affected to couple <i>religion and
      morality</i> together, and to represent them as <i>inseparably united</i>,
      though the slightest attention must show that they are perfectly <i>distinct</i>,
      and a full and mature consideration of the subject must prove that they
      are even extremely <i>opposite</i>. They well knew that man, in the most
      abject state of mental degradation to which superstition could reduce him,
      must still acknowledge the force and excellence of virtue and morality,
      and must perceive their necessary tendency to promote his welfare and
      happiness. They well knew how useful to their own views and interests it
      would be to persuade him that religion, virtue, and morality, were one and
      the same, or, at least, intimately and inseparably connected; the
      credulity of man gave credit to the imposture without examination, and the
      uniform experience of above 2,000 years has not hitherto been sufficient
      to undeceive him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unhappy man! destined for ever to be the dupe of his own credulity, in
      opposition to the testimony of his experience, and the evidence of his
      senses. Does not the history of all ages show, that the most religious
      nations have always been, and still are, the most vicious and immoral!
    </p>
    <p>
      Another most formidable evil necessarily results from such a system of
      superstition, that is, a state of civil slavery, which is always found its
      universal concomitant. Whenever the human mind is debased and degraded by
      a system of gross superstition, it becomes incapable of any one manly,
      liberal, or independent sentiment; every energy of the mind is lost,
      reason is surrendered, virtue, the chief support, if not the sole
      foundation of freedom, is banished, and man is fitted to receive the
      abject yoke of slavery; tyranny and despotism make an easy conquest of
      him, and the priest is ever ready to rivet his chains, and perpetuate his
      bondage, by the pretended sanction of Heaven. The power and influence of
      the priest and the tyrant is ever in proportion to the debasement of man;
      they have a common interest, have ever made a common cause against him,
      and have constantly erected their common throne on the ruins of his
      freedom, his welfare, and his happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us not, therefore, be deterred from unmasking to the view of mankind
      that immense mass of vice and depravity which constitute the foundation of
      the Jewish superstition; let no blind veneration for that hideous idol
      deter us from exposing its deformity; let us cultivate that which is truly
      good and useful; let reason assume her just empire over the mind of man,
      and credulity, ignorance, and folly, abdicate their usurped dominion: then
      shall we soon behold the galling fetters of vice and superstition broken
      by the irresistible power of virtue, morality, and truth.

    <h2>
      THE LIFE OF DAVID.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The first establishment of regal government among the Hebrews, was
      occasioned by the corrupt administration of Joel and Abiah, the two sons
      of Samuel, whom he had deputed to judge Israel in the decline of his
      life.* The people, exasperated at the oppression they laboured under,
      applied to Samuel for redress, testifying a desire to experience a
      different mode of government, by peremptorily demanding a king.** At this,
      however, Samuel was greatly displeased: not that his sons had tyrannized
      over the people, for of that he takes no manner of notice, neither
      exculpating them, nor promising the people redress; his chagrin arose from
      this violent resumption of the supreme magistracy out of the hands of his
      family; a circumstance for which he expresses great resentment.*** He
      consults the Lord, and not knowing else how the insurrection might
      terminate, in his name yields to their desires; promising them a king with
      vengeance to them.**** "For,"(5) says the Lord, "they have not rejected
      thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them."(6)
      The people, nevertheless, resolving to free themselves from present
      oppression, at the hazard of the threatened judgments, obstinately
      persisted in their demand, and dispersed not without a promise of
      compliance.

      Samuel, to all outward appearance, chose the most impartial method of
      choosing a king, which was by lot, from among the people assembled by
      tribes; but prudently pitches upon his man, previous to the election; the
      whole tenor of his conduct manifesting, that he intended to give them a
      king in name, but still to retain the supreme authority in his own hands,
      by choosing one who should continue subordinate to his dictates.
      Opportunely for his purpose, a young countryman, named Saul, having
      rambled about to seek his fathers asses, which had strayed, and finding
      all search after them vain, applied to Samuel as a prophet,* with a fee in
      his hand, to gain intelligence of his beasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      We gather from several passages in Jewish history, that there were
      seminaries of prophets, i.e. the universities of the times, where youth
      were trained up to the mystery of prophesying. We find there were false
      prophets, nonconformists, not of the establishment; we find that even the
      true ones were liable to be imposed on by their brethren;** and we find
      moreover, by this instance, that prophets did not disdain to give
      assistance in their prophetical character, concerning domestic matters,
      for reasonable gratuities. A chief among the prophets, one who had been a
      judge over Israel, is applied to in a pecuniary way, for intelligence
      concerning lost cattle.***

     *** Pretensions to divinations continue to this day, though,
     in the opinion of reformed churches, all prophesying and
     miracles have long since ceased. These modern prophets are
     drolly ridiculed by our facetious countryman, Butler, in the
     person of Sydrophel, a dealer,

          "In Destiny's dark counsel?,
          Who sage opinions of the moon sells;
          To whom all people, far and near,
          On deep importances repair.
          When brass or pewter hap to stray,
          Or linen slinks out of the way;
          When geese and pullen are seduc'd,
          And sows of sucking pigs are chous'd:
          When cattle feel indisposition,
          And need th' opinion of physician;
          When murrain reigns in hogs or sheep,
          And chickens languish of the pip;
          When yeast and outward means do fail,
          And have no power to work on ale;
          When butter does refuse to come.
          And love proves cross and humoursome;
          To him with questions and with urine,
          They for discov'ry flock, or curing.
</pre>
    <p>
      It has been said, that this is the only instance recorded of a prophet
      being applied to for purposes of this nature; but it appears that it was
      usual for men to have recourse to prophets, and that the phrase was,
      "Come, and let us go to the seer;"* and that prophetical intelligence was
      paid for, is evident from the inquiry between Saul and his servant,
      concerning their ability to gratify him.**
    </p>
    <p>
      But, to proceed: Saul not only found his asses, but a kingdom into the
      bargain; and had the spirit of the Lord given;*** to him which we find
      taken away**** again, when he proved untractable: though it seems somewhat
      odd, how he could possibly prove disobedient, while he acted under the
      influence of this Divine Spirit! For, the possibility being admitted, the
      advantage of inspiration is difficult to be conceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Samuel had in private(5) anointed Saul king, and told him his asses
      were already found, he dismissed him for the present. He then assembled
      the people for the election of a king: at which assembly, behold, the lot
      fell on the tribe of Benjamin; and in that, on the family of Matri; and
      finally, on Saul, the son of Kish.(6) An election somewhat resembling
      consistories for the appointment of bishops; where the person being
      previously fixed on, God is solemnly prayed to for a direction of their
      choice.

      It is not intended here to give a detail of the reign of king Saul; the
      notice hitherto taken of him being merely because the life of David could
      not be properly introduced without mentioning the alteration of
      government, and the manner in which monarchy was established in Israel:
      since Samuel's disappointment in Saul, naturally leads to his similar
      choice of David.
    </p>
    <p>
      The disobedience of Saul, in daring to sacrifice without his patron the
      prophet,* who failed of coming according to his appointment; and his
      lenity and prudence, in sparing the king, and some cattle, from a nation
      which Samuel, in the name of the Lord, had commanded him utterly to
      extirpate,** irrevocably lost him the favour of this imperious inexorable
      prophet: and, in the end, produced the miserable destruction not only of
      himself, but of his family: which will occasion no surprise, when we
      consider the absolute dominion and ascendency which the Jewish priests
      maintained over this ignorant superstitious people. A dominion which every
      article in the Levitical law enlarged and strengthened.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are not to imagine that the sparing Agag, king of the Amalekites, was
      the only cause of this rupture between him and Samuel. For we may gather
      from other parts of his history, that Saul was not over-well affected
      towards his patrons the Levites;*** in subjection to whom he had too much
      spirit to continue. Samuel quickly perceived he had mistaken his man, he
      haughtily avowed his intention of deposing him;**** and ordering Agag to
      be brought into his presence, he hewed him in pieces&mdash;"before the
      Lord."(5)

      We now come to the hero of the history.
    </p>
    <p>
      In pursuance of his intention to make another king, Samuel went under the
      pretence of a sacrifice, and anointed another country youth, which was
      David, the youngest son of Jesse, the Bethlehemite; and gave him the
      spirit of the Lord, which he had just taken from poor Saul. The king, in
      the mean time, reflecting on the precariousness of his situation, now that
      the priests, on the part of Samuel, were incensed against him; and well
      knowing their influence among his subjects, fell into a melancholy
      disorder of mind,* which his physicians were unable to remove.**
    </p>
    <p>
      This was artfully made the occasion of introducing David to court. The
      king was advised to divert himself with music; and David was contrived to
      be recommended to him for his skill on the harp.*** Saul accordingly sent
      to Jesse, to request his son; which was immediately complied with: and
      David was detained at court, in the capacity of the king's
      armour-bearer.**** Here the story begins to grow confused, beyond <i>lay</i>-skill
      to reconcile. A war with the Philistines is abruptly introduced; in the
      midst of the relation of which, we are abruptly informed that David
      returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep(5) again; from whence his
      father sent him with provisions for his brothers, who were in the army.(6)
      What can be thought of this? Jesse hardly recalled his son from the
      honourable post of armour-bearer to the king; it is not likely that he was
      turned off, since we afterwards find him playing on the harp to the king,
      as before;(7) neither was it proper employment for the king's
      armour-bearer to be feeding sheep, when the army was in the field, and his
      majesty with them in person! Why&mdash;the most easy method is to take it
      as we find it; to suppose it to be right, and go quietly on with the
      story.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Philistine army was a man of extraordinary size, named Goliah, who
      came out of their camp, day by day, challenging and defying any one among
      the Hebrews to single combat, and to rest the decision of their quarrel
      upon the event; an offer which no one among the Israelites was hitherto
      found hardy enough to accept.(8)

    <p>
      David is said to have arrived at the army just as it was forming for
      engagement; at which time the giant advanced as before, with reproachful
      menaces; and, after having enquired carefully concerning what reward would
      be given to the conquerer of this giant, and learning that great riches
      and the king's daughter were to be the prizes of conquest, David
      courageously declared before Saul his acceptance of the challenge,*
      notwithstanding the contempt with which his offer had been treated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saul, relying on the youth's ardour and assurance of victory, girded his
      own armour on him:** but David put it off again, trusting entirely to a
      pouch of stones, and his own skill in slinging.*** The success answered
      his hopes, and stamped, what would otherwise have been deemed a rash
      undertaking, with a more respectable name; he knocked Goliath down with a
      stone; then ran in upon him, cut his head off with his own sword, and
      brought it triumphantly to the king of Israel.**** The consequence was the
      defeat of the 'Philistines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we meet with another stumbling-block. For, though Saul, as has
      already been observed, had sent to Jesse expressly for his son David;
      though David had played to him on the harp; though Saul had again sent to
      Jesse, to desire that David might be permitted to stay with him; and in
      consequence of this had given him a military appointment about his person;
      though he had now a fresh conference with him; had just placed his own
      suit of armour on him; and though all the occurrences must have happened
      within a small space of time, yet his memory is made so to fail him on a
      sudden, that he knew nothing either of David, or his parentage! but while
      David went to meet the giant, he enquired of others, who proved as
      ignorant as himself, whose son(5) the stripling was? This stumbling-block
      must likewise be stepped over, for it is not removeable.

    <p>
      The reputation which this gallant action procured to David, soon gained
      him advancement in the army, and a warm friendship with Saul's son,
      Jonathan. But the inordinate acclamations of the people, on account of the
      death of the Philistine giant, "Saul hath slain his thousands, and David
      his ten thousands;"* a rhodomontade out of measure extravagant, when we
      compare the two subjects of the contrast, justly occasioned Saul to view
      David with a jealous eye. We have all the reason in the world to believe
      that Samuel and the priests made every possible advantage of an adventure
      so fortunate for their intended king, to improve his growing popularity,
      which even at its outset had so far exceeded all bounds of decency:
      "What," said Saul, "can he have more but the kingdom?"** and we may
      therefore conclude that the king saw enough to alarm him; for we are told,
      that "Saul eyed David from that day and forward,"***Thus we find that on
      the following day, while David played as usual on his harp before Saul,
      the king cast a javelin at him,**** which David avoided. Saul then made
      him captain over a thousand, saying, "Let not mine hand be upon him, but
      let the hand of the Philistines be upon him," an expression however which
      is evidently put into Saul's mouth, since it is impossible he could have
      made use of it openly. He made him the offer of his daughter Merab for his
      wife, in consequence of the defeat of Goliah; but she, we know not why,
      was given to another;(5) afterwards he gave him Michal: and David's
      modesty (6) on this occasion was incomparably well acted; he knowing
      himself, at the same time, to be secretly intended for the kingdom by
      Samuel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saul, upon reflection, concluding it dangerous to execute any open act of
      violence against this young hero, politically hoped to ensnare him, by
      exalting him high in favour, or to get rid of him by putting him upon his
      mettle, in performing feats of valour; for a deficiency of valour is not
      to be numbered among David's faults. It was with this view that the king
      yet required of him an hundred Philistine foreskins(7) as the condition of
      becoming his son-in-law. He produced double the number "in full tale."(8)

      This demand, after David appeals to have fulfilled the prescribed
      conditions, seems not only unjust, but also, even making allowance for
      Hebrew customs, very ridiculously expressed. It must have been a glorious
      sight to have seen David bring the foreskins to king Saul, strung perhaps
      on a piece of pack-thread, and dangling in his hand, or thrown across his
      shoulders like a sash: and if Miss Michal was present, how must her pretty
      little heart exult when the required number being told off, as many more
      were gallantly presented at her feet!
    </p>
    <p>
      David still advanced in his military** reputation, and met with a powerful
      advocate in the person of Jonathan, his brother-in-law and faithful
      friend, who effected a temporary reconciliation between him and Saul;***
      at which time Saul swore he would no more attempt his life. Nevertheless,
      whether it was that he could not get the better of his jealousy, or that
      he discovered more than is transmitted down to us, we know not;
      consequences incline us to the last conjecture: Saul made two more
      attempts to kill him;**** from one of which he was protected by his wife
      Michal; and finding it not safe to stay at court, he fled to Samuel, in
      Ramah.(5) Hither Saul sent messengers to apprehend him;(6) but these, it
      seems, seeing Samuel presiding over a company of prophets, and
      prophesying, were seized with a spirit of prophesying also; and not only
      so, but it is related that Saul finding this, went at last himself, to
      just the same purpose; for he likewise prophesied,(7) stripping off his
      cloaths, in which ridiculous condition he continued for a day and a night.

      This is an extreme odd relation! That the solemn appearance of an assembly
      of prophets, presided over by a person so respectable, and heretofore of
      such great authority in Judea, might influence, in an extraordinary
      manner, persons entrusted with a commission to apprehend or kill a man
      patronized by these prophets, exhibits nothing wonderful; they might
      easily perhaps, be prophesied out of their errand; and might then prophesy
      in concert. Prophesy is a vague term, not always limited to the prediction
      of future events; the extempore preaching of many dissenters, and the
      discourses of the Quakers, who profess to speak as the Spirit gives them
      utterance, seem to come under the term prophesy. These persons can work
      themselves and others into such fits of enthusiastic intoxication, that
      they believe themselves agitated by supernatural influence. Such might be
      the prophesying here mentioned. But Saul prophesied! so it is said. Had
      the subject of Saul's prophesying, been transmitted down to us, it might
      have greatly illustrated this passage in the history; but no, he is barely
      said to have <i>prophesied</i>; and we are prudently left to guess what.
      Being thus at liberty, we, among other expositors, may easily surmise what
      he might take for his text, and was the general tenor of his discourse, on
      this particular occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterward David had a private interview* with Jonathan; for he durst not
      venture to appear at court. At this meeting, Jonathan, who had conceived
      too great an affection for this man, and was at length seduced by him from
      the duty and allegiance which he owed to his father and king, solemnly
      promised** that he would sound his father's intentions on the next day,
      which being the festival of the new moon, David's attendance was expected
      at the king's table; and that he would warn him of any danger intended
      him.

<pre xml:space="preserve">

     ** Ver. 12.

    <p>
      David lay hid in the field until Jonathan brought him the required
      intelligence; and when the king inquired, concerning him, Jonathan as had
      been before concerted, said that he had requested leave to go and perform
      a family sacrifice at Bethlehem. Saul's reply on this occasion is very
      pertinent, and shows his antipathy to David not to have been the causeless
      inveteracy of a disordered mind. "Then Saul's anger was kindled against
      Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman,
      do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own
      confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness? For as long
      as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established,
      nor thy kingdom: wherefore now send and fetch him unto me; for he shall
      surely die."* Jonathan expostulated with his father, and had a javelin
      hurled at him for his reward.**
    </p>
    <p>
      David being advertised, according to agreement, of the king's disposition
      toward him, retired to Ahimelech, the high priest, at the city of Nob who
      treated him with shew-bread, and armed him with the sword of Goliah, which
      had been hung up and consecrated to God.***
    </p>
    <p>
      We may consider David's resuming this sword, after its dedication as a
      religious trophy, whatever gloss may be put on his interview with
      Ahimelech, to be a clear manifestation of hostile intentions, or a
      declaration of war against his father-in-law, for which he now took the
      first opportunity to prepare. Thus accoutred, he fled out of Judea, to
      Achish, king of Gath;**** intending, as we have good reason to believe, to
      enter into a treaty of alliance with him against the Hebrews; but the
      popular cry was against him before he accomplished any thing, or at least
      any thing that has reached our times.

      carrying with him the sword of Goliah was artful enough, and likely to
      collect followers in Judea, since it was a continual witness of that
      prowess which had gained him such extraordinary reputation; yet, for him,
      under this circumstance, to throw himself into the power of the
      Philistines, among those very people from whose champion he had ravished
      <i>that sword</i>, was the highest imprudence! and we perceive he might
      have suffered for it, had not he made use of a stratagem to procure his
      release, which he effected by acting the madman.* Mankind seems to have
      been very easily imposed on in those days.

      David, now thinking it time openly to avow his design of disputing the
      crown with Saul, went to a cave called Adullam, which he appointed the
      place of rendezvous for his partizans. Here we are told he collected
      together a company of debtors, vagrants, and disaffected persons, to the
      number of four hundred; and opened his rebellion, by putting himself at
      the head of this body of men:** men, whose desperate situations under the
      government in being, rendered them fit agents to disturb it, and proved
      the surest bond to connect them to a partizan thus embarked in an
      enterprize against it. Hither also came to him his father and all his
      brethren; and the first movement that he made was to go to the king of
      Moab, to obtain a retreat for his father and mother, until he knew the
      event of his enterprise.***

      By the advice of the prophet Gad, David next marched into the land of
      Judah:**** Gad, no doubt hoped, that as the young adventurer was of that
      tribe, he would there meet with considerable reinforcement. When Saul
      heard of this insurrection, he pathetically laments his misfortune to
      those about him, that they, and even his son Jonathan, should conspire
      against him.(5)

      Then started up one Doeg, an Edomite, who informed Saul, that he had seen
      David harboured by the priests in Nob. Upon this, Saul summoned all those
      belonging to that city before him, with Ahimelech their chief, who began
      to excuse himself as well as he could; but Saul remembering, without
      doubt, the threatening of Samuel, concerning the affair of king Agag;* and
      considering these priests as traitors, from this corroborating evidence
      against them, he commanded them all to be slain, to the number of
      eighty-five persons.** Moreover, agreeable to the barbarous usage of that
      nation, the massacre included the whole city of Nob, man and beast, young
      and old, without exception.

      Though the king's rage in this instance exceeded not only the bounds of
      humanity, but also of good policy, it nevertheless serves to show how
      deeply the priests were concerned in the rebellion of David; since he
      could not be mad enough to commit so flagrant an act, without some
      colourable pretence;*** and shows also that Saul had not so great an
      opinion of their holiness as we, at this distance of time, are, by their
      own annals, instructed to have. Had Saul been more implicit, he might have
      enjoyed the name of king, have continued the dupe of the priests, have
      died in peace, and his children have succeeded quietly to the inheritance.

      But upon the approach of Saul, not thinking himself able to maintain it,
      being as yet but six hundred strong, and not choosing to confide in the
      inhabitants, whose loyalty even his recent kindness to them could not
      corrupt, he therefore abandoned it, and retired to the wilderness.* This
      passage alone is amply sufficient to confirm the reality of David's
      rebellious intentions; it is, therefore, worth analyzing. That he
      delivered this city from the depredations of the Philistines, and that by
      this action he hoped to purchase the friendship of the inhabitants, are
      acknowledged: the use to which he intended to convert this friendship, is
      the point to be ascertained. Saul was advancing to suppress him. Had he
      seduced them from their allegiance, and obtained the expected protection,
      he would have deprived Saul of this city, which city might have been
      considered as a garrison. The old plea, of his providing only for his
      personal safety, against his malignant persecutor, has often been urged;
      but his intended retention of a city, to secure that safety, was a
      flagrant rebellious intention. Had he gained this one city, as his
      strength increased, he would have concluded as many more as he could have
      procured, necessary for his preservation, until he had monopolized the
      whole country, agreeable to the grant of Samuel, which would then have
      justified the usurpation; but disappointed in the first step, by the
      loyalty, miscalled treachery, of the Keilites, he evacuated the town,
      having lost the recompence of his labour, and with his men "went
      whithersoever they could go."** In the wilderness Jonathan came privately
      to see him, and piously engages in the cause against his own father, by
      covenant; in which it was agreed, that if David succeeded, of which
      Jonathan is very confident, <i>he</i> was to be a partaker of his good
      fortune but as Jonathan was not to join him openly, he went home again.

      Saul, having received intelligence of David's retreats, pursued him from
      place to place, until he was called off by news of an invasion of the land
      by the Philistines;*** whether of David's procuring or not, we are
      uncertain: thus much is certain, and does not discredit the supposition,
      that he quickly after took refuge among those Philistines.

      After repelling the invaders, Saul, however, returned to the wilderness of
      Engedi, in pursuit of David, with three thousand chosen men. At this place
      we are told of an odd adventure, which put the life of Saul strangely into
      the power of David. He turned in to repose himself* alone in a cave,
      wherein at that time, David and his myrmidons were secreted.**
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The words are, "to cover his feet:" which Josephus and
     others, mistake to mean, that he retired into the cave to
     ease nature. But in Judges, iii. 21. we find that expression
     to imply, that the servants of Eulon, king of Moab, supposed
     their master to have locked himself in, to repose himself
     with sleep, in his summer-chamber. This is farther
     corroborated, in Ruth, iii. 7. where, when Boaz had eaten
     his supper, he laid down on a heap of corn, doubtless to
     take his rest. Ruth, by her mother's instruction, went,
     uncovered his feet, and lay down by him&mdash;to have some
     refreshment likewise. For, in the middle of the night, when
     the man awaked, surprised at finding an unexpected
     bedfellow, and demanded who she was, the kind wench replied&mdash;
     "I am Ruth, thine hand-maid; spread therefore thy skirt
     over thine hand-maid, for thou art a near kinsman." In the
     present instance, it is evident, Saul slept in the cave; as
     he discovered not the operation that had been performed on
     his robe, till David called after him, to apprize him
     thereof.

      This, one would imagine to have been a fine opportunity for him to have
      given a finishing stroke to his fortune, by killing Saul, and jumping
      into, the throne at once: but David knew better what he was about, than to
      act so rashly. He could entertain no hopes that the Jews would receive for
      their king a man who, with such great seeming holiness, should imbrue his
      hands in the blood of the Lord's anointed. Beside, what evidently destroys
      the boasted merit of David's forbearance toward Saul, in this instance, is
      an obvious, though overlooked consideration, that, compared with David,
      Saul had a strong army with, him; and had the king been missing, had he
      been observed to enter the cave without coming out again; and upon search,
      had he been there found murdered, there would not have escaped, of all
      that pertained to David, any that <i>pissed against this wall</i>. Of this
      David could not be insensible; and therefore, only privately cut off the
      skirt of Saul's robe,* and suffered him to depart in peace. When the king
      was gone out from the cave, David calls after him, and artfully makes a
      merit of his forbearance, protesting an innocency, to which his being in
      arms was, however, a flat** contradiction. Saul freely and gratefully
      acknowledges himself indebted to him for his life, and seems so well
      convinced of his own precarious situation, that he candidly confesses it;
      only tying him down with an oath,*** not to destroy his children after him&mdash;an
      obligation which, in due time, we shall see in what manner remembered and
      fulfilled by David.

      Saul must certainly have been greatly fatigued, or strangely overseen, to
      have let David catch him at so great a disadvantage&mdash;a conduct not
      usual with good generals. Yet, while we credit the relation, the meanness
      of his reply to David's harangue, can be no otherwise accounted for. Saul
      does not appear to have wanted resolution on other occasions; but to
      acknowledge his assurance that David would obtain the sovereignty, and
      poorly to entreat a fugitive rebel in behalf of his family! is a conduct
      not even to be palliated, but upon the foregoing supposition. We must
      either condemn the general or the king, neither of which characters appear
      with extraordinary lustre upon this occasion. David, on the other hand,
      dissembles admirably here, pretending to Saul a <i>great reverence</i> for
      the Lord's anointed, though conscious, at the same time, that <i>he was
      also</i> the Lord's anointed, and anointed purposely to supersede the
      other Lord's anointed; and, moreover, was at this very time aiming to put
      his election in force! But, as the people were not of his council, and he
      knew their great regard for religious sanctions, it was certainly prudent
      in him to set an example of piety, in an instance of which he hoped, in
      time, to reap the benefit himself: About this time Samuel died.*

      We next find our young adventurer acting the chief character in a
      tragi-comedy, which will farther display his title to the appellation of
      being a Man after God's own heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      There dwelt then at Maon, a blunt rich old farmer, whose name was Nabal.
      David hearing of him, and that he was at that time sheep-shearing, sent a
      detachment of his followers to levy a contribution upon him,** making a
      merit of his forbearance, in that he had not stolen his sheep, and
      murdered his shepherds.*** Nabal, who, to be sure, was not the most
      courteous man in the world, upon receiving this extraordinary message,
      gave them but a very indifferent reply, including a flat denial. "Who,"
      says he, "is David? and who is the son of Jesse? There be many servants
      nowadays that break away every man from his master. Shall I then take my
      bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and
      give unto men whom I know not whence they be?"**** Upon receiving this
      answer, David, without hesitation, directly formed his resolution; and
      arming himself, with a number of his followers, vowed to butcher him, <i>and
      all that belonged to him</i>, before the next morning.(5) And how was this
      pious intention diverted? Why, Abigail, the charming Abigail! Nabal's
      wife, resolved, unknown to her spouse, to try the force of beauty, in
      mollifying this incensed hero, whose disposition for gallantry, and warm
      regard for the fair sex, was probably not unknown at that time. Her own
      curiosity also might not be a little excited; for the ladies have at all
      times been universally fond of military gentlemen: no wonder, therefore,
      that Mrs. Abigail, the wife of a cross country clown, was willing to seize
      this opportunity of getting acquaintance with captain David.

      And this motive certainly had its force, since she could not as yet have
      known David's intention: we may observe she was told of it by David at
      their meeting.* She prepared a present, and went to David, saying, very
      sententiously, "Upon me, my Lord, upon me let this iniquity be:"**
      judging, very humanely, that could she get him to transfer his revenge
      upon <i>her</i>, she might possibly contrive to pacify him, without
      proceeding to disagreeable extremities. Nor was she wrong in her judgment;
      for we are told, "So David received of her hand that which she had brought
      him, and said unto her, go up in peace to thine house; see I have
      hearkened to thy voice, <i>and have accepted thy person</i>."*** But
      however agreeable this meeting might have been to Abigail, we do not find
      that Nabal was so well pleased with the composition his wife had made for
      him; for when he came to understand so much of the story as she chose to
      inform him of, he guessed the remainder, broke his heart, and died in ten
      days afterward. David loses no time, but returned God thanks for the old
      fellow's death, and then Mrs. Abigail was promoted to the honour of being
      one of the Captain's ladies.(5)

      We are now told another story extremely resembling that of the cave of
      En-gedi. Saul again pursues David with three thousand chosen men; again
      fell into his hands during his sleep; only that here David stole upon him
      in his own camp; he ran away with the king's spear and bottle of water,
      and Saul went back again as wise as he came.(6)

      The opinion of Mons. Bayle seems most probable concerning this adventure,
      who looks upon it but as another detail of the former affair at En-gedi;
      and that for very good reasons. For, upon a comparison of both, as laid
      down in the 23d, 24th, and 26th chapters of 1 Samuel, we may remark,
    </p>
    <p>
      I. That in each relation Saul pursues him with the same number of chosen
      men.
    </p>
    <p>
      II. That both adventures happened at or very near the same place.
    </p>
    <p>
      III. That in each story David comes upon Saul in much the same manner,
      withholds his people from killing him, and contents himself with taking
      away a testimonial of the king's having been in his power.
    </p>
    <p>
      IV. That in the second account, When David is pleading the injustice of
      Saul's persecuting him, as he terms it, he does not strengthen his plea by
      representing to him that this was the <i>second time</i> of his sparing
      him, when he had his life so entirely in his power; and that Saul's
      pursuing him this second time, was a flagrant instance of ingratitude,
      after what had happened on the former occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      V. That in the second relation, Saul, when he acknowledges David's
      forbearance and mercy to him in the present instance, makes no mention of
      <i>any former obligation</i> of this kind, although it was so recent, and
      in the main circumstance so similar.
    </p>
    <p>
      VI. That the historian, who evidently intended to blacken the character of
      Saul, and whiten that of David, does not make the least observation
      himself, in the second narrative, of reference to the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      These reasons prove, beyond doubt, that we are furnished with two
      relations of the same adventure. To account for the double record, and
      their variations, must be left to commentators, connectors, and
      harmonizers, who are used to compromise affairs of this nature.

      David finding that with his present strength, he was unable to maintain
      any footing in Judea, puts himself once more under the protection of
      Achish, king of Gath.* Achish, who does not appear to have been a very
      powerful prince, seemed to consider David alone, and David at the head of
      a little army, as two very different persons: for he now assigned him a
      place named Ziklag, for a habitation, where he remained a year and four
      months.**

      As he had now a quiet residence, those who entertain an opinion of David's
      sanctity, would be apt to suppose he would here confine himself to
      agriculture, to composing psalms, and to singing them to his harp; but
      David found employment more suited to his genius. It is not intended here
      to be insinuated that he might not sing psalms, at leisure times; but his
      more important business was to lead his men put to plunder the adjacent
      country. We have the names of some nations, as they are called, but which
      must have been small distinct communities, like the present camps of
      wandering Moors and Arabs, over whom he extended his depredations: these
      are the Geshurites, the Gezrites, and the Amalekites.** Of these people he
      made a total massacre, at those places where he made his inroads; saying,
      very prudently, "Lest they should tell of us, saying, so did David, and so
      will be his manner, all the while he dwelleth in the country of the
      Philistines."***
    </p>
    <p>
      After thus carefully endeavouring to avoid detection, he brings his booty
      home, which consisted of all which those miserable victims possessed.****
      He made presents of this to his benefactor king Achis,(5)| who, demanding
      where he had made his incursion, was answered, against the south of Judah,
      &amp;c.(6) intending by this falsity to insinuate to the king his aversion
      to his own countrymen, and attachment to him. "And Achish believed David,
      saying, he hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he
      shall be my servant for ever,"(7)
    </p>
    <p>
      The Philistines at this time collected their forces together, to attack
      the Israelites. To which service Achish summoned David,(8) and met with a
      cheerful compliance.

      "Surely," says David, "thou shalt know what thy servant can do."* He
      accordingly marched his adherents with the troops of king Achish; but when
      the princes of the Philistines saw a company of Hebrews in their army,
      they were much surprized, and questioned Achish concerning them. The
      account which Achish gave of them, did not satisfy the princes, who justly
      feared their captain might prove a dangerous auxiliary. "Make this fellow
      return," said they, "that he may go again to the place which thou hast
      appointed him, and let him not go down with us to the battle, lest in the
      battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should be reconcile himself
      to his master; should it not be with the heads of these men David was
      accordingly dismissed, very much mortified at their distrust of him.**

      Here now was a signal evidence of David's righteousness! The Hebrews,
      according to their own testimony, understood themselves to be the
      favourite people of God, and David is delivered down to us as a
      distinguished character for piety among this peculiarly esteemed people.
      Yet could this very man, without any hesitation, freely join himself and
      company, to an army of uncircumcised idolators, marching with hostile
      intentions against his countrymen! His advocates indeed pretend, that had
      his offers been accepted, he would nevertheless have gone over to the
      Israelites, at the commencement of the battle: this is taking off the
      charge of one crime, by imputing to him another equally bad&mdash;a most
      base act of treachery! As, however, the Israelites, on the foundation of
      their own intimacy with the Deity, thought they had no more obligations to
      a moral conduct towards the heathens, than the Roman Catholics now imagine
      they have to keep faith with heretics; these advocates endeavour to
      preserve the piety of David's character, at the expence of what David,
      according to this method of arguing, did extremely well without, on all
      occasions; namely, <i>honesty</i>.***

      Upon his return to Ziklag, he found that, during his absence, the
      Amalekites had made reprisals upon him, and burnt Ziklag; and had carried
      off all the women captives.* But in the relation there is one remark well
      worth noting, which is that "they slew not any either great or small"**&mdash;so
      much more moderation had these poor heathens in their just revenge, than
      the enlightened David in his unprovoked insult. If they came to avenge so
      savage an insult, it shewed great consideration in them to spare the
      innocent, the guilty being absent: if they only came on the common
      principle of plunder, the bare comparison of the different treatment of
      the sufferers in each instance, speaks forcibly without amplification.
      Upon this misfortune, his band began to mutiny, and were on the point of
      stoning*** him; when he, who knew how to soothe them, enquired of the Lord
      what he should do? and evaded their rage, by inspiring them with a
      resolution to pursue the Amalekites, and with the hopes of recovering all
      their losses. He, therefore, with four hundred picked men, set out on the
      pursuit, and by the way found a straggler**** who had fainted: after
      recovering him, they gained, by his means, intelligence of their route.
      David came upon them unexpectedly, at a place where they were, without
      apprehension, regaling themselves after their success: and though David's
      men recovered all they had lost, together with other booty, and found
      their wives and children unhurt: yet could not their captain resist so
      inviting an opportunity of gratifying his delight in blood-shedding: the

      but by the defeat of the latter, the death of Saul, and of three of his
      sons.**
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the catastrophe of king Saul! a man advanced from the humble
      state of a shepherd, by the prophet Samuel, to be his deputy in the
      government of the Hebrew nations under the specious name of king: a man,
      who allowing for the <i>peculiar complexion</i> of the people over whom he
      was placed; does not, on the whole, seem to suffer by comparison with any
      other king in the <i>same</i> history; or whose character appears to be
      stained with any conspicuous fault, except that he was one degree less
      cruel than his haughty patron: and was disobedient enough to endeavour to
      be in effect, what he was only intended to be in name. On the whole, he
      appears to have been strangely irresolute and inconsistent with himself;
      and is perhaps represented more so than he might really have been: but the
      undertaking to render himself independent was an arduous task for one in
      his situation; therefore his actions and professions might sometimes
      disagree. However, it is impossible to argue from every expression that
      may be produced; we must form our judgment from leading events, and
      corresponding expressions; and determine as they tally with probability.
      If Saul himself, however he is represented as subscribing to it, was
      really assured of David's destination to supersede him by divine decree,
      there was nothing left for him but resignation: Can man fight against God?
      since therefore his continual aim was to destroy David, it argues against
      this assurance: and if Saul himself was mad, surely his soldiers were not:
      how came he to find an army as mad as himself, to persecute the Lord's
      anointed.

      We shall now have an opportunity to observe the conduct of our hero in a
      regal capacity. The death of Saul facilitated his advancement to a
      sovereignty, to which he had no pretension, either by the right of
      inheritance, which was claimed by Ish-bosheth, a remaining son of Saul;
      nor by popular election, which Saul himself had the shew of; but by the
      clandestine appointment of an old prophet; which inspired him with hopes,
      of which, by arms and intrigue, he at length enjoyed the fruition.
    </p>
    <p>
      David had returned to Ziklag but two days, when on the third, there came
      to him an Amalekite, who officiously informed him of the event of the
      battle between the Israelites and Philistines. He owned himself to be the
      person who killed Saul, after his defeat, at his own request: he being
      already wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hoped to be well rewarded for his news, by David; whose intentions were
      so well known, that he presented him with Saul's crown and bracelet*. But,
      alas! he knew not David, and perished in the experiment: David ordering
      him to be killed for daring to slay the Lord's anointed.** David's
      treatment of this Amalekite, is agreeable to the customary rules of
      politics; and has nothing therefore remarkable in it, farther than it is
      rendered so by peculiar circumstances. Saul was declared to be rejected by
      God, and David was the pretender to his throne; it may therefore be
      imagined by some, that this man might have had some claim to <i>his</i>
      private gratitude, especially considering the account the Amalekite gave
      of the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who can help smiling at the relation of David's tearing his clothes off
      his back, and bursting into a sorrowful lamentation for the death of a
      man, to whose destruction he had so freely offered to lend assistance but
      just before?
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this alteration of affairs, David, asking counsel of the Lord, was
      advised to leave Ziklag, and go to Hebron, one of the cities of Judah;
      whither he and all his men repaired.***

      There he got his partizans to anoint him king over Judah; at the same time
      that Abner, Saul's general, had, at Mahanaim, made Ishbosheth,
    </p>
    <p>
      Saul's son, king over Israel.* It may be remarked here, that David did not
      seem to claim in right of the sacred unction bestowed on him long since by
      Samuel. He realized his title indeed, as soon as he could make it out, by
      the law of force: but if his divine title to the Hebrew crown was
      universally known, and if, as has been urged, Ish-bosheth had none at all,
      how came David's title not to be universally acknowledged? Did only one
      tribe believe in it? Yet David, with the divine grant, was obliged to
      obtain the sovereignty by arms and intrigue! just for all the world like
      the wicked, who attain their desires by exactly the same means, to all
      external appearance. Upon this division of the kingdom, a battle was
      fought at the pool of Gibeon, between the army of Ish-bosheth, commanded
      by general Abner, and that of David, headed by Joab: victory declared in
      favour of the latter, with small loss on either side, except that Joab
      lost his brother Ahasel, who was killed by Abner's own hand.**
    </p>
    <p>
      We must here be content with general hints; being only informed that
      "there was long war between the house of Saul and the house, of David: but
      David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and
      weaker."*** What very much conduced to this, was an ill-timed quarrel
      between king Ish-bosheth and general Abner, concerning one of Saul's
      concubines, with whom Abner had been too familiar:**** and his resentment
      of the notice taken of this amour, occasioned a treaty to be negociated
      between him and David, whom Abner engaged to establish over all Israel.(5)
      David accepted his offer, but demanded, as a preliminary, the restoration
      of his first wife Michal;(6) who, during the disputes between him and
      Saul; had been espoused to another.(7)

      This demand he likewise made openly, by an express message to Ishbosheth,
      who kindly complied with it: the poor man who had since married her,
      following her weeping all the way.**
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible to avoid noting David's amorous disposition here; which
      could not be content with six wives, who bare him children*** (no mention
      of those who did not), but was yet so warm, that it took the lead even in
      his most important concerns.&mdash;We will not pretend to assign the cause
      of that sad disorder, the symptoms of which are described in the 38th
      Psalm.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Abner had traitorously endeavoured to advance the interest of
      David****; he had an interview with him;(5) which, quickly after he
      returned, coming to the ears of Joab; he, who does not appear to have been
      acquainted with the secret spring which actuated Abner's zeal for the
      cause of David; represented to him the imprudence of admitting a man among
      them, who to all appearance came only as a spy. Unknown to David, he sent
      for him back again, and privately stabbed him, in revenge for the loss of
      his brother Asahel.(6) This was a most base piece of treachery, worthy the
      servant of such a master: to assassinate a man in cool blood, in revenge
      for an action which was committed in the heat of battle, in self-defence,
      and even after fair warning given.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the murder of Abner, David again acts the mourner;(7) which has a
      greater probability of being sincere now, than when he grieved for the
      unhappy Saul; because the false Abner was preparing to do him essential
      service, by betraying his master's cause.

      But the event proved full as advantageous to David; as will presently
      appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Ishbosheth and his friends heard of the fate of Abner, who had been
      the very life of their cause; it dejected all their spirits; and two
      villains, named Rechab and Baanah, hoping to make their fortunes by the
      public calamity, went and murdered their master king Ishbosheth, as he was
      reposing himself during the heat of the day, and brought his head to
      David*. But not reflecting on an obvious maxim in politics, they like the
      Amalekite before, who claimed the merit of killing Saul, soon found that,
      he thought it adviseable to punish the traitors, whatever he thought of
      the treason.**

    <p>
      Had David reflected on all the circumstances which led to this murder,
      with that tenderness becoming a person professing so much piety, his
      compunction would have greatly embarrassed him in the proper behaviour on
      this occasion. For if these two execrable villains deserved punishment,
      what did <i>he</i> merit who was the primary cause of so nefarious an
      action? Two poor rogues from subordinate views, effected by assassination
      what David sought at the head of an army, which naturally reminds us of
      the pirate and Alexander. So strangely do relative circumstances bias our
      judgment of things essentially alike. Had David aspired to no other
      sceptre than his shepherd's crook, the villains had not presumed on the
      usurper's gratitude; and Ish-bosheth, who was a quiet prince, might have
      reigned long an honour to himself and a blessing to his country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ish-bosheth does not appear to have been a man of parts, qualified to
      contend with such an antagonist as David; for nothing is recorded of him:
      Abner was the person who raised him; and had he lived, would as easily
      have deposed him, and though no qualifications are a security against
      assassination, yet, as in the case of another unfortunate monarch, Darius,
      king of Persia; such cowardly wretches generally take the advantage of
      precipitating misfortunes already commenced, that they may pay their court
      to the rising sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      The murder of this unhappy son of an unhappy father, advanced David to the
      dignity to which he aspired,* (though we shall see in a passage which
      reflects no great honour on him, that Saul had more sons yet living.) He
      was now in his thirty-eighth year; having reigned seven years and an half
      in Hebron** over the tribe of Judah.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although David was now invested with that supremacy which had been the aim
      of his endeavours since the time that Samuel inspired him with the spirit
      of &mdash;&mdash;- ambition; yet could not his enterprising genius
      continue satisfied with such an exaltation. The first object of his
      attention now, was the city of Jerusalem, then inhabited by the Jebusites;
      (but it was of no importance who inhabited it, if David conceived a desire
      for it): this city he besieged and the inhabitants relying on the strength
      of their fortifications, out of derision planted cripples on their
      ramparts to guard their walls; saying "except thou take away the blind and
      the lame, thou shalt not come in hither."*** Nevertheless David carried
      the place, and made it his chief city.****
    </p>
    <p>
      N. B. He supplied himself with, more wives and concubines out of his new
      acquisition.(5)
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was thus amorously engaged, the Philistines hearing that he Was
      made king over all Israel, came and disturbed him; but David according to
      the usual term <i>smote them</i>;(6) and his strokes were always
      sufficiently felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The comic tale of David's bringing home the ark will not be long dwelt
      upon; it may only be remarked, that it was brought on a new cart, drawn by
      oxen; and that Uzzah some way or other lost his life, to, as the text
      reads, was smote <i>by the Lord</i>,(7) for his impiety in saving the ark
      from being overturned.(8)

      But if "the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looked on the outward
      appearance, but the Lord looked into the heart." the intention of Uzzah
      was indisputably good, and the alledged crime surely pardonable; the
      seeming exigency precluding all hesitation and reflection. Had the ark
      been really overturned for want of this careful prevention, Uzzah might
      then, it would be naturally imagined, have been rather <i>smote</i> for
      neglecting to save it. However, it was no longer trusted to prophane
      hands, but carried the remainder of the way upon the more holy shoulders
      of the Levites,* with great parade: attended by musicians, and by David
      himself who, dressed in a linen ephod, <i>danced before the Lord with all
      his might</i> and this, in such a frantic indecent manner, that he exposed
      his nakedness to the bye-standers. Wherefore his wife Michal sneered at
      him: "How glorious was the king of Israel today, who uncovered himself
      to-day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain
      fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself."** David, it seems, was of a
      different opinion; for he told her he <i>would</i> play before the Lord;
      and would be yet <i>more vile</i> than she had represented him;&mdash;adding,
      "and of the maid-servants which thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be
      had in honour."*** Some staunch zealots have very prudently spiritualized
      this part of David's answer, and given the mystical sense of it; the
      prophane, who are content with the evident signification of words, having
      construed it no otherwise than into an insinuation that he had no cause to
      be ashamed of what he exposed. Fie on them!
    </p>
    <p>
      This story is concluded with a remark as odd as the rest of it:&mdash;"Therefore
      Michal, the daughter of Saul, had no child until the day of her death.(5)
    </p>

    <p>
      For, if Michal had hitherto borne no children, neither to David, nor to
      her immediate husband, her barrenness must have been constitutional; and,
      preceding her offence, could not be a punishment inflicted in consequence
      of it. Moreover, if, on the other hand, she <i>had</i> borne him children,
      and this disgrace to her was the consequence of a resolution made by her
      husband David, that she should have no more children <i>by him</i>: her
      quiet resignation, under this imposed widowhood, is by inference a high
      compliment on this poor woman's conjugal virtue! which was far from the
      historian's intention to bestow. Indeed there is great reason to credit
      Michal, and to believe that David really behaved with all the extravagance
      she ascribes to him: for she appeared before this affair as a discreet
      kind of a woman; no instance of folly being produced in her, unless the
      contrivances she made use of to save her husband from the effects of her
      father's rage may be allowed to bear such interpretation. Whatever
      judgment however is passed upon Michal's censure of David's behaviour in
      this procession, it showed great cruelty and ingratitude in him to fix so
      disgraceful a stigma on her; and not to make allowance for female
      indiscretion, the worst name that could be bestowed on her fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, David smote the Philistines, not sparing even Gath, that city
      which had so humanely protected him.* He then smote the Moabites, putting
      to the sword two-thirds of the nation, by causing them to lie prostrate on
      the ground, and measuring them by lines; "even with two lines measured he
      to put to death; and with one full line to keep alive:"** so systematic
      was his wrath! Hadadezar, king of Zobah, was the next whom he smote; who
      being assisted by the Syrians of Damascus, he next smote them.*** Yet all
      this smiting and slaying is so obscurely mentioned, that we know nothing
      of the offences committed against this mighty chief, to excite such
      blood-thirsty indignation.

      Indeed, the cause is, without much difficulty, deducible from the produce
      of these wars, which sufficiently indicate the nature of David's <i>thirst.</i>
      Great quantities of gold, silver, and brass, are said to have been brought
      to Jerusalem;* and the priests may with reason be supposed to be the
      instigators to these wars; since we find all the plunder surrendered to
      them.** We have therefore no cause to wonder at the exalted praises they
      have bestowed upon the instrument of their wealth. He is said to have "gat
      him a name, when he returned from smiting the Syrians."*** &mdash;This may
      very easily be credited; but it is to be feared, that if the name he gat
      from the Jews, and that which he gat from the Syrians were compared, they
      would not accord extremely well together.
    </p>
    <p>
      David was at this time seized with a <i>temporary</i> fit of gratitude
      toward a lame son of his old friend Jonathan, named Mephibosheth, to whom
      he restored all the private patrimony of his grandfather Saul, and took
      him into his family;**** not without due consideration, it is to be
      supposed; since by that means he kept him under his own eye. But this
      gratitude, was not lasting; for upon an accusation preferred against him
      by his servant, David readily bestowed all Mephibosheth's possessions upon
      that servant;(5) yet, when the accusation was found to be false, instead
      of equitably punishing the asperser of innocence, and reinstating
      Mephibosheth in his former favour, he restored to him but half the
      forfeiture of his supposed guilt,(6) leaving the villain Ziba in the quiet
      possession of the other half, as the reward of his treachery.&mdash;But of
      this in its proper place.

      In the midst of an obscure detail of smiting and slaying; in revenge for
      the contemptuous treatment of some ambassadors, sent by him with
      compliments of condolence; but who, perhaps deservedly, were considered as
      spies; while Joab was with the army prosecuting the siege of Rabbah, a
      chief city of the Ammonites; David, then at Jerusalem, walking one evening
      on the roof of his palace, perceived from that eminence a handsome woman
      bathing herself.* Fired with the sight, he sent to enquire who she was:
      and understanding she was Bathsheba, wife to Uriah, who was at that time
      opportunely absent in the army under Joab, he caused her to be brought to
      him directly, (no ceremony in the case) and after gratifying his
      inclination, sent her home again.** Some time after, the woman finding
      herself with child, naturally informed the king of it. He, never at a loss
      for ways and means, immediately ordered Uriah home;*** of whom he enquired
      news concerning the operations of the campaign, and then dismissed him to
      his own house, sending after him a present of victuals.**** David intended
      the good man a little relaxation from the fatigues of war, that he might
      kiss his wife, and be cheated into a child more than he had a natural
      right to; but whether Uriah had received any intimation of the honour his
      Majesty had done him; or whether he honestly meant the self-denial which
      he professed, we are not advertised: however, Uriah would not go home but
      slept in the guard-room, with the king's servants.(5) David took care to
      be informed of this, and questioned Uriah concerning the reason of it.
      Uriah urged a scruple of conscience against going to enjoy any indulgence
      at home, while the ark, Joab, and the army remained in tents in the open
      field.(6) He was detained another night; when David made him drunk,(7)
      waiting to see what effect that might have. It was still the same; Uriah,
      like many other drunken men, was resolved not to go home.

      David, finding him so obstinate, altered his plan of operations, and
      determined then to get rid of him for ever. To which intent, he sent him
      back to the camp, with a letter to the general. "And he wrote in the
      letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the fore-front of the hottest battle, and
      retire ye from him, that he may be smitten and die."* This instruction was
      accordingly complied with;** and then Bathsheba, like another Abigail, was
      taken into David's seraglio.***
    </p>
    <p>
      Nathan the prophet read David an arch lecture upon this subject;**** and
      he, who took care not to disagree With his best friends, bore with the
      reproof, and humbled himself accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This complicated crime committed by David is universally allowed; but
      people think so little for them selves, that even <i>this</i> would be
      qualified, were it not found ready condemned to their hand in the relation
      of it. This crime is given up too, as the <i>only stain</i> in David's
      character: but the circumstances of it will not permit this to be granted,
      abstracted from any consideration of the man. For, though a generally good
      man may, in a sudden start of any of the passions, lose government of
      himself so far, as to violate conjugal fidelity, or perhaps suddenly to
      kill another; yet a deliberate scheme, including <i>two</i> such crimes,
      can be concerted only by a <i>bad heart</i>. It is also to be remarked
      respecting his famous repentance of this black transaction, that he shewed
      no tokens of relenting until it was extorted from him by artifice! and
      that even then, though he mourned his crime, he never entertained a
      thought of relinquishing future commerce with the woman so wickedly
      obtained, but kept her until he died! and altered the regular course of
      succession, in favour of a son he had by her.(5)
    </p>
    <p>
      It is hoped the supposition may be allowed, that the noise this righteous

      How shall a person subject to the feelings of humanity, (a security of
      more avail among men than the most binding laws) how shall a man, not
      steeled to a very Jew, find expressions suited to the occasion, when he
      relates the treatment of this poor city, Rabbah? The study would be as
      difficult as unnecessary; the simple unexaggerated tale, if seriously
      attended to, will shock the humane reader sufficiently. The city was taken
      and plundered; and David "brought forth the people that were therein, and
      put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron,
      and made them pass through the brick-kiln, and thus did he unto all the
      cities of the children of Ammon."**

     * It is supposed that the ancient slavery of the Jews to the
     Egyptians, and the labour they were employed in by their
     lordly taskmasters, the making bricks, might be a current
     reproachful jeer upon the Jews, when any quarrel happened
     between them find their neighbours; and that the making
     their prisoners pass through the brick-kiln, was a cruel
     method of revenging such affronts. A conjecture not

      The precise punishments here alluded to are not understood at this time:
      writers being much divided in their expositions of these words; but that
      extraordinary punishments are meant, cannot admit of a doubt; for though
      <i>believers</i> expound the putting the Ammonites <i>under</i> saws and
      harrows, into the making slaves of them, and that these were the tools
      with which they laboured; yet this will not agree with the latter of the
      texts whose authority is mentioned in the note; where it is said, that he
      [David] "cut them with saws and with harrows of iron, and with axes." And
      should more evidence be yet required, Josephus also writes, that "the men
      were put to death by exquisite torments." The general truth of the fact
      stands therefore unimpeached. And is it thus the people of God, headed by
      a man styled, in a peculiar manner, <i>the man after God's own heart</i>,
      used the prisoners of war? <i>Bella! horrida bella!</i>

      Ammon, one of our hero's sons, ravished his sister Tamar, and then turned
      her out of doors.* Absalom, her brother by the same mother, seemingly took
      no notice of it, until two years after; when he invited all his brothers
      to a feast at his sheep-shearing; where he made Amnon drunk, and murdered
      him** in so deliberate, and yet so determined was his revenge! Absalom on
      this account, fled out of Judea, for three years*** until, at the entreaty
      of Joab, he was invited home again by his father, whose favourite he
      was.**** But though he returned to Jerusalem, yet would not his father see
      him for two years more.(5)
    </p>
    <p>
      Absalom, during his exile, conceived a design of deposing his father; for
      after their reconciliation, his first attention was to render himself
      popular. To this end he set up a splendid equipage:(6) but politically
      increased his affability with his magnificence: rising up early, and
      planting himself in the way, to salute all who came to his father's levee.
      Of these he kindly enquired their business, or grievances; throwing out
      hints of the king's remissness in the execution of justice, and how
      uprightly he would conduct himself, were their causes to be determined by
      him.(7)

      The profession of piety is universally, and was in particular a-mong this
      people, the most successful disguise for crafty designing men to assume.
      When Absalom, therefore, thought his scheme sufficiently ripe for
      execution, he desired leave of his father to go to Hebron, to perform a
      vow made by him while a refugee in Syria.* At Hebron he set up his
      standard, and his followers assembled in such numbers, and the defection
      was so general, that David thought it adviseable to retire from
      Jerusalem.**
    </p>
    <p>
      With him he took all his family and dependants, except ten concubines,
      whom he left in his palace to keep house.*** The priests, Zadock and
      Abiather, with the ark, would also have gone with him; but he thought it
      would be more for his service for them to remain in the city as spies; to
      send him intelligence how matters went.**** It is no inconsiderable part
      of politics to know how to suit men with proper employments, Ahitophel,
      his prime minister, joined the malecontents;(5) to balance which
      misfortune, David prevailed on Hushai, a trusty man of some importance, to
      remain in the city, that he might ingratiate himself with Absalom, thwart
      the counsels of Ahitophel, and transmit intelligence to him from time to
      time through the conveyance of the priests, whose sons were to carry on
      the correspondence.(6) Having concerted matters thus, he evacuated
      Jerusalem, and Absalom entered(7) it.

      When David was upon his journey from the city, he was met by Ziba, servant
      to Mephibosheth, with asses and provisions for his majesty's accommodation
      in his retreat:(8) of whom, when David enquired why Mephibosheth did not
      come with him; this treacherous servant told him that he staid behind at
      Jerusalem, hoping to obtain the kingdom of his grandfather, during this
      disturbance:(9) by which lying aspersion, he gained a grant of all his

      Here we may introduce a circumstance, which is so far material, as it
      serves to shew, that the sanctity of David was not quite so universally
      assented to, as may be imagined, while he was living; and his actions not
      only fresh in memory, but more perfectly known, than possibly, was prudent
      to transmit to these distant ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      As David prosecuted his flight, he was met by a man of Saul's family,
      whose name was Shimei. This man as he came on, kept muttering curses
      between his teeth, and at length cast stones at the King and his
      attendants, calling out to him, "Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and
      thou man of Belial; the Lord hath returned upon thee all the blood of the
      house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned, and the Lord hath
      delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son; and behold thou
      art taken in thy mischief because thou art a bloody man."* This is
      pathetic, and truly characteristic of the person to whom the speech was
      addressed. Some of his retinue were at the point of silencing; this
      brawler with the "ultima ratio regum;"** but David prevented it,*** wisely
      considering this not to be a season for proceeding to extremities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Absalom, in the mean time, being come to Jerusalem, like a buck of spirit,
      took the damsels which his father had left to keep house, and cuckolded
      the old man by way of bravado, on the top of it****; in a tent erected for
      this heroic purpose!
    </p>
    <p>
      Ahitophel advised Absalom to select twelve thousand men, and pursue David
      directly, before he had time to recover his surprize;(5) which was
      certainly the best resolution that could have been formed. But Hushai, as
      was concerted, proposed a different plan of operations; opposing to the
      former, the well known valour and military skill of the old king; and the
      hazard of making him and his men desperate.(6)

      He advised a collection of all the troops in the kingdom; that success
      might be in a manner insured; and that Absalom should command them in
      person. By which means, he affirmed that they should overwhelm David and
      his party, wherever they found him.* Hushai gained the ascendancy; and
      when he knew that his scheme was accepted, he gave immediate notice to the
      priests:** with instructions for David how to conduct himself.*** David
      divided his forces into three bodies; commanded by Joab, Abishai, and
      Ittai: but by the prudent care of his men, was not permitted to hazard his
      person, by being present in action.**** When he had reviewed his army, he
      gave his generals especial charge to preserve the life of Absalom; and
      with a policy that reflects honour upon his military knowledge, expected
      the enemy in the wood Ephraim:(5) a covert situation, being the most
      judicious that could be chosen, for a small army(6) to encounter one more
      numerous. David's men were tried veterans, among whom were the remains of
      those who served under, and lived with him at Gath;(7) whereas, Absalom's
      army must have consisted chiefly of fresh men. The battle decided in
      favour of David(8) with great slaughter of the rebel army: and as Absalom
      fled on a mule, his hair, which is celebrated for its beauty and quantity,
      entangled in the boughs of an oak, and he remained suspended in the air;
      while his mule ran away from between his legs.(9) He was observed in this
      condition by a man who went and told Joab; and he, who consulted the
      safety of David, rather than his parental weakness in behalf of an
      unnatural son, killed Absalom with a dart.(10)
    </p>
    <p>
      David grieved immoderately for this reprobate son, on whom he had
      misplaced a great affection:(11) and though he had <i>acted</i> the
      mourner on several former occasions, this is the only one, in which his
      sincerity need not be questioned.

      It is true, he might be really concerned at the murder of Abner; but men
      circumstances ought to be attended to; Abner was killed prematurely; he
      had not finished his treacherous negociation; David had much to hope from
      him; but&mdash;when his expectations had been answered, it is far from
      being improbable, that he would have found an opportunity himself to have
      got rid of a man, on whom he could have placed no reliance. But to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      David was roused from his lamentations by the reproaches of his victorious
      general,* who flushed with success, told him the truth, but, perhaps, told
      it too coarsely. It is evident that Joab now lost the favour of his
      master, which the murder of Abner, the killing Absalom in direct
      contradiction to David's express order; and lastly, his want of sympathy,
      and his indelicacy in the present instance, were the apparent causes.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the battle, he invited Amasa, Absalom's vanquished general, to
      return to his duty: very imprudently and unaccountably promising him the
      chief command of his army in the stead of Joab;** which was seemingly but
      an unthankful return for the victory that officer had just gained him, and
      for his attachment to his interest all along. Amasa, it is true, was a
      near relation; but Joab, according to Josephus, stood in the same degree
      of consanguinity; they being both the sons of David's sisters, this offer
      must therefore have been rashly influenced by his resentment against Joab,
      as before mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remains of Absalom's scattered army dispersed to their homes in the
      best and most private manner they could:*** but David inadvertantly
      plunged himself into fresh troubles, by causing himself to be conducted
      home by a detachment from the tribe of Judah.**** This occasioned disputes
      between that and the other tribes. They accused Judah of stealing their
      king from them.(5)

      Judah replied, that they gave their attendance, because the king was of
      their tribe; and that it was their own free will:* the others rejoined
      that they had ten parts in the king, and that their advice should have
      been asked as to the bringing him back.** At this juncture, one Sheba took
      advantage of the discontent, "and blew a trumpet, and said, we have no
      part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man
      to his tent, O Israel."*** The consequence of this, was a second
      insurrection. Amasa was ordered to assemble an army to suppress it; but
      not proceeding with the desired speed, Abishai was afterward commissioned
      with the same trust; Amasa and Abishai met and proceeded together, and
      were joined by Joab and his men. But Joab, not thoroughly liking to serve
      under a man he had so lately vanquished, and having as few scruples of
      conscience as his old master, made short work, stabbed Amasa, and
      reassumed the command of the whole army.****
    </p>
    <p>
      Being once again supreme in command, Joab proceeded directly to the
      reduction of the malecontents who shut themselves up in the city of Abel
      of Beth-maacha: he battered the town, but by the negociation of a woman,
      the inhabitants agreed to throw Sheba's head to him over the wall; which
      they performed;(5) and thus was quiet once more restored. Joab returned to
      Jerusalem, where we are told that he was general over all the host of
      Israel.(6) Not a syllable appears of any notice taken by David of the
      murder of the general by himself appointed: and of the assassin's usurping
      the command of the army.

    <p>
      Not finding room in its proper place, it shall now be noticed, that when
      David was returning to Jerusalem from the reduction of Absalom's
      rebellion; with the men of Judah, who came to escort him, Shimei, the
      Benjamite,(7) joined him at the head of a party of his own tribe.

      These intestine troubles put David upon pondering how to secure himself,
      as far as he could forecast, from any future disturbance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the part of good politicians, not only to form wise designs
      themselves, but also to make proper advantage of public occurrences, that
      all events indiscriminately may, more or less, lead to the purposes wanted
      to be obtained. Of this policy we shall observe David to be mindful, in
      the ensuing transaction. Not that a panegyric upon his contrivance in this
      instance is by any means intended; for certainly a more barefaced
      transaction was never exhibited: such indeed as could only have been
      attempted among the poor bigoted Jews. It is sufficient, however, that it
      answered David's purpose; than which more could not have been expected
      from the most complete stroke that refined politics ever produced. But
      view it in a moral light, and certainly a blacker piece of ingratitude and
      perfidy can hardly be imagined. It was impossible to continue the
      narrative without prefacing thus much.
    </p>
    <p>
      David having with much trouble, from his competition with Ish-bosheth,
      established himself upon the Jewish throne; and having in the latter part
      of his reign been vexed, and driven to disagreeable extremities, by the
      seditious humour of his subjects, the rebellion of his own son Absalom,
      and the revolt of Sheba; his mind now fell a prey to suspicion. He called
      to remembrance that some of Saul's family were yet living; whom, lest they
      should hereafter prove thorns in his side, he concluded it expedient to
      cut of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever David projected any scheme, a religious plea, and the assistance
      of his old friends,* were never wanting. A famine befel Judea, which
      continued three years: probably occasioned by the preceding intestine
      commotions. "David inquired of the Lord: and the Lord answered, it is for
      Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites."** But
      where is this crime recorded? Samuel charged Saul with no such slaughter:
      he reproached him with a contrary fault, an act of <i>mercy!</i> which is
      assigned as one of the reasons for deposing him. So that this crime was
      not recollected,*** till many years after the man was dead! and then God
      punishes&mdash;whom? a whole nation, with three years famine: which, by
      the by, was not sent as a punishment neither; but merely as a hint of
      remembrance, which ended in hanging the late king's innocent children!
    </p>
    <p>
      The oracular response dictated no act of expiation; but only pointed out
      the <i>cause</i> of the famine. So that the Gibeonites (who, by the way,
      had hitherto made no complaints that we know of) were applied to**** for a
      knowledge of what recompence they demanded.

     Jebusites, and others, who at times became the object of
     David's wrath? That the charge may allude to some former
     affair, is not contested; it is, however, truly remarkable,
     that there should be no chronological record of a fact,
     which after such a length of time demanded an expiation so
     awfully hinted, and so extraordinary in its circumstances!

      They required no gifts, neither that for their sakes David should kill any
      man in Israel (which qualifying expressions seems artfully intended; since
      they only required David to <i>deliver</i> the men to <i>them</i>, that <i>they</i>
      might kill them); but that seven of Saul's sons, should be surrendered to
      them, that they might hang them up&mdash;<i>unto the Lord</i>.* David, not
      withheld by any motives of gratitude toward the posterity of his unhappy
      father-in-law, but in direct violation of his oath at the cave of
      En-gedi,** granted the request he must himself have instigated,*** sparing
      only Mephibosheth, who luckily was so unfortunate as to be a cripple, and
      so much a dependant on David, and kept under his own eye, that he had no
      room for apprehension from him. He therefore reserved Mephibosheth, in
      memory of another oath between him and his father Jonathan. Mephibosheth
      having such a shocking scene to contemplate, and, considering his
      decrepitude, might (as he really was) with little hazard be preserved, as
      an evidence of probity in this pious king.
    </p>
    <p>
      A conscience of convenient flexibility is of great use: thus David being
      under obligation by two oaths, forgot one, and remembered the other. When

      and by Satan,(5) to cause his subjects to be numbered: which is, oddly
      enough, imputed as a great sin in him to require: for, poor man, according
      to the premises, he was but a passive instrument in the affair.

      Even David should have his due. The prophet Gad called him to account for

      We have now attended David down to the decline of his life: when his
      natural heat so far decayed, that no addition of clothing** could retain a
      proper degree of warmth. His physicians prescribed a young woman to
      cherish him in his bed, by imparting to him a share of juvenile heat.***
      This remedy may be very expedient in cases of extreme age: but why beauty
      should be a necessary part of the prescription is difficult to conceive.
      They sought a <i>fair damsel</i>; and the damsel they found, was <i>very
      fair.</i>**** Possibly David might himself direct the delicacy of the
      choice: but if his physicians intended it as a compliment to their master,
      it indicated a very insufficient knowledge of the animal oeconomy: thus to
      stimulate the old man, and harass a carcase already sufficiently worn out:
      whereas a virgin of homelier features, at the same time that she would
      have furnished an equal degree of warmth, would have been less liable to
      put wicked thoughts in the patient's head.(5) However, the historian has
      taken care to inform us, that "the king knew her not:"(6) an assertion,
      which, from the premises, there does not appear any reason to controvert.

      While the king lay in this debilitated extremity of life, he was destined
      to experience yet another mortification from his children. Adonijah his
      eldest son, since the death of Absalom, taking advantage of his father's
      incapacity, foolishly assumed the title of king,* which, had he been a
      little less precipitate, would have soon fallen to him, perhaps, without
      contest. For though David afterwards is represented as having secret
      intentions to alter the succession, yet the countenance shewn to his
      pretension by Joab, the general, by Abiathar the priest, and even by all
      his other brothers,** seem to indicate, that had Adonijah been more
      prudent, we should not now have heard so much of the wisdom of Solomon, It
      is possible Adonijah might, even as it was, have maintained his
      anticipated dignity, had he not, like Saul before, slighted his most
      powerful friends. He made an entertainment, to which he invited all his
      brothers, except Solomon;*** but what ruined him, was his not inviting
      Nathan the prophet; it was <i>there</i> the grudge began: and the
      exclusion from this merry bout, and the confidence of the party, caused
      the prophet's loyalty to exert itself,**** which might probably have been
      suppressed by a due share of Adonijah's good cheer.

      Let not the writer be accused of putting a malicious construction upon
      every transaction he produces. Pray, reader, turn to your bible: in the
      tenth verse of the first chapter of the first book of Kings, you will find
      a remark that Nathan was not called to the feast. The very next verse
      begins, "Wherefore, Nathan spake unto Bathsheba, the mother of Solomon,"
      &amp;c. He was certainly nettled at the slight put on him, and some
      others, in not being invited to Adonijah's feast, else he would not have
      insisted on that circumstance; which had better been waved. The
      supposition is not so ridiculous as has been represented; for surely the
      probability of Nathan's being corrupted, was not less than that of David's
      sons; who, yet, all of them, except Solomon, (who, had he been invited,
      had some private reasons to the contrary, which their proceedings shew
      them to have been aware of) were agreeable to settling the succession on
      their elder brother; though certainly as much interested in the disposal
      of the kingdom, as Nathan could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nathan and Bathsheba concerted to inform David of this matter;* where the
      affronted prophet could not forget the slight put upon him; but, it being
      foremost in his mind, he insists upon the circumstance of exclusion, in an
      earnest manner; "But me, even me, thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and
      Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not
      called;"** which spake the cause of his officious loyalty but too plainly.
      David here acknowledges the promise by which he waved the right of
      primogeniture in favour of Solomon, Bathsheba's son.*** He now directed
      him to be set upon a mule, to be proclaimed and anointed king of Israel,
      by his appointment.**** The acclamations of the people upon this
      raree-shew disturbed the opposite party at their table; and an event, so
      unexpected, quite disconcerted them: they all dispersed;(5) Adonijah ran
      to the tabernacle, and took sanctuary at the altar. He obtained of Solomon
      a conditional promise of pardon,(6) depending on his good behaviour.(7)

      And now, methinks, some gentlewoman, of more than feminine patience, whose
      curiosity may have prevailed with her to proceed thus for, may here
      exclaim; "It must be granted, Sir! that David had his faults; and who has
      not? but what does that prove? only that he was a man. If he was frail,
      his repentance was exemplary; as you may perceive, if you can prevail with
      yourself to read some of his psalms. Indeed, after your ill-treatment of
      the scripture, it will avail little to tell you that you contradict those
      inspired penmen, who expressly stile David, <i>the Man after God's own
      heart</i>. Nay, your writing against him, under that epithet, shews
      sufficiently the rancour and impiety of <i>your heart</i>; so that I am
      fearful there are small hopes of reclaiming you."&mdash;Good Madam! hear
      me calmly, and we shall part excellent friends yet. Had David not been
      selected from the rest of mankind, why then&mdash;it is possible&mdash;hardly
      possible&mdash;he might pass in the gross, with the rest of the Jewish
      kings. But, when he is exalted and placed in a conspicuous point of view,
      as an eminent example of piety! he then necessarily attracts our notice in
      an especial manner, and we are naturally led to wonder, that a more happy
      subject of panegyric had not been chosen. If he was an holy psalmist; if
      he is styled the Man after God's own heart; he also lived the life here
      exhibited: and his capability of uniting such contrarities, does but
      augment his guilt!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, even in his psalms, he frequently breathes nothing but blood, and the
      most rancorous resentment against his enemies. Of these take a specimen or
      two, from the elegant <i>ekeings</i> out of that transcendent pair of
      geniuses, Messrs. Thomas Sternhold and John Hopkins; in recommendation of
      whose version, and the taste of our countrymen, it may be truly affirmed,
      that their psalms have gone through more editions than the works of any
      other poet, or brace of poets, whatever.

      Very pious ejaculations for the whole congregation to <i>sing to the
      praise and glory of God!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      David's failings, as they are qualifyingly termed, are generally mentioned
      as exceptions to the uniform piety of his character: but, if David ever
      performed any truly laudable actions, <i>those</i> are the real exceptions
      to the general baseness which stains the whole of a life uncommonly
      criminal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The writer does not pledge himself to reconcile rapine and cruelty, with
      morality and religion; there are Commentators who love these knotty
      affairs; to them they are left. When the vindictive tenor of any of
      David's psalms has been insisted on, the translation is immediately
      censured; prudently enough; as every one who has sense to perceive the
      incongruity between such bloody wishes and denunciations, and the
      acknowledged purity and mercy of the All-beneficent Father of Nature, may
      not have learning enough to dispute about Hebrew points, and to make them
      point what meaning he pleases. However, such a one, by comparing the
      labours of Hebrew critics, may yet be enabled to form some sort of
      judgment between them. For instance, in that terrible 109th psalm, it is
      certain our Doctors in Divinity do not like it: but something must be done
      with it: some, therefore, say, that the verbs are not translated in their
      proper tenses, and that prophetic declarations are thus mistaken for the
      Psalmist's execrations: others again say, that to be sure they <i>are</i>
      imprecations, but not the imprecations of David; but those of his enemies
      on him, which he there only relates! O happy men! why do not we all learn
      Hebrew? His exemplary repentance is pleaded; is it any where to be found
      but in the psalms? "By their fruits ye shall know them." If David was ever
      truly pious, we shall certainly perceive it in his behaviour on his
      death-bed. <i>There</i>, it is to be hoped, we shall find him forgiving
      his enemies, and dying in charity with all mankind. This is what all
      mankind in general make a point of, from the saint to the malefactor.
      David, therefore, must certainly give us an extraordinary instance of his
      attention to this important evidence of contrition, But what shall we
      think, when we see this Nero of the Hebrews die in a manner uniform and
      consistent with the whole course of his life? What will be our
      reflections, when we find him, with his last accents, delivering two cruel
      and inhuman murders in charge to his son Solomon? Murders still further
      aggravated by the included crimes of ingratitude and perjury! one of them
      to be executed on his old faithful general, Joab, who powerfully assisted
      him on all occasions, and who adhered to him in all his extremities, till
      at the last, when he had justifiable cause for chagrin: but who,
      notwithstanding, had not appeared against him in actual hostility; but
      only drank a glass of wine with the malcontents. It will avail nothing to
      plead the private faults of the man; we are now to consider him as
      relative to David, in his public capacity. In which light we must loath
      the master, who died meditating black ingratitude against so faithful, so
      useful a servant. For even his defection at last may, perhaps, admit of
      being interpreted into a patronization of that particular plan for the
      succession, rather than into a rebellion against the superannuated
      monarch.
    </p>
    <p>
      His other charge was against Shimei, who reviled David at his retreat from
      Jerusalem, during Absalom's rebellion; but who made his submission to him,
      when he returned victorious: and whose pardon David had sealed with a
      solemn oath.*
    </p>
    <p>
      Attend we now to the cause of these reflections. After exhorting Solomon
      on his death-bed, to keep the statutes of the Lord, David proceeds:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Moreover, thou knowest also what Joab, the son of Zeruiah, did to me, and
      what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son
      of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood
      of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about
      his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let NOT HIS HOAR HEAD GO DOWN
      TO THE GRAVE IN PEACE."**
    </p>
    <p>
      This was afterwards fulfilled in the basest manner, by the administrator
      to this pious testament.
    </p>
    <p>
      David concludes thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      "And behold, thou hast with thee Shimei, the son of Gera, a Benjaminite of
      Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse, in the day when I went to
      Mahanaim; but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to him by the
      Lord, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, therefore, hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man, and
      knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou
      down to the grave with BLOOD."*** &mdash;That is to say, 'It is true, I
      promised not to put him to death, but thou art a wise man, and knowest
      what thou oughtest to do; thou knowest thyself not to be bound by that
      obligation; therefore his hoar head, &amp;c. So saying, he expired!

      This command was also executed in a manner, worthy of a son of SUCH A
      FATHER.
    </p>
    <p>
      To take a retrospect view of the foregoing narrative; in few words may be
      seen the sum total of the whole. A shepherd: youth is chosen by a
      disgusted, prophet, to be the instrument of his revenge on an untractable
      king. To this, end he is inspired with ambitious hopes, by a private
      inauguration; is introduced to court, in the capacity of a harper; and by
      knocking down a man with a stone whom, if he had missed once, he had four
      more chances of hitting, and from whom, at the last, he could have, easily
      ran away; he was advanced to the dignity of son-in-law to the king. So
      sudden and unlooked for a promotion within sight of the throne, stimulated
      expectations already awakened; and Saul soon perceived reasons to repent
      his alliance with him. Being obliged to retire from the court, he
      assembled a gang of ruffians, the acknowledged outcasts of their country,
      and became the ringleader of a lawless company of banditti. In this
      capacity he seduces his brother-in-law, Jonathan, from his allegieance and
      filieal duty; and covenants with him, that if he obtained the kingdom,
      Jonathan should be the next person in authority under him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He obtains a settlement in the dominions of a Philistine prince where
      instead of applying himself laudably to the arts of cultivation he
      subsists by plundering and butchering the neighbouring nations.
    </p>
    <p>
      He offered his assistance to the Philistine armies, in a war against his
      own country, and father-in-law; and is much disgusted at their distrust of
      his sincerity. He however, availed himself of the defeat and death of
      Saul, and made a push for the kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of this he gained only his own tribe of Judah: but strengthened by this
      usurpation, he contested the remainder with Saul's son, Ishbosbeth, whom
      he persecuted to the grave: Ishbosbeth being assassinated by two villains,
      with intention to pay their court to the usurper. He is now king of
      Israel: In which capacity he plundered and massacred all his neighbours
      round him at discretion. He defiled, the wife of one of his officers,
      while her husband was absent in the army: and finding she was with child
      by him, He, to prevent a discovery, added murder to adultery; which being
      accomplished, he took the widow directly into his well-stocked seraglio.
      He then repaired to the army, where he treated the subjected enemies: with
      the most wanton inhumanity. A rebellion is raised against him by his son
      Absalom, which he suppressed, and invited over the rebel-general, to whom
      he gave the supreme command of his army, to the prejudice of the
      victorious Joab. After this, he cut off the remainder of Saul's family, in
      defiance to the solemn oath by which he engaged to spare that unhappy
      race; reserving only one cripple from whom he had not apprehensions: and
      who, being the son of Jonathan, gave him the opportunity of making a merit
      of his gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he lay on his death-bed, where all mankind resign their resentments
      and animosities, his latest breath was employed in dictating two
      posthumous murders to his son Solomon! and, as if one crime more was
      wanting to complete the black catalogue; he cloathed all his actions with
      the most consummate hypocrisy: professing all along the greatest regard
      for every appearance of virtue and holiness. These, Christians! are the
      outlines of the life of a Jew, whom you are not ashamed to continue

      who entertain adequate conceptions of the eternal rectitude of that great
      Creator of the universe, whom they profess to adore. He despises all the
      pious ravings and anathemas which have been thundered against him by some
      reverend inquisitors: he expected them, has exposed them; and hopes he
